# EAN Expansion Plan

## Status: COMPLETED

EAN expansion is effectively complete as of Session 8 (Feb 9, 2026).

**Coverage**: 1,000/1,029 active products (97.2%) have valid EAN-8/EAN-13 barcodes.

The migration to the Open Food Facts v2 API in Session 8 resolved the EAN gap permanently. All products generated by the pipeline now automatically receive their OFF `code` field as their EAN. After category expansion through Session 11 (1,029 active products across 20 categories), 29 products remain without EANs — all are Żabka store-prepared items that do not have barcodes in the OFF database.

See [EAN_VALIDATION_STATUS.md](EAN_VALIDATION_STATUS.md) for detailed coverage by category.

## Historical Context

This plan was originally created during Session 5 when EAN coverage was 33.4% (149/446 products). The phased expansion approach (Dairy, Bread, Plant-Based, Meat, Alcohol, etc.) was partially executed through manual OFF API research in Sessions 5-7, reaching 267 EANs (47.9%).

The breakthrough came in Session 8 when the pipeline was migrated from the broken `search.pl` endpoint to the `/api/v2/search` endpoint. Since the v2 API returns product codes with every result, all regenerated categories automatically received EANs, making the manual expansion plan obsolete.
